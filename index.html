        <h3>Eevee and Hair Ties</h3>

            This is one of my cats, Eevee. She is a domestic shorthair that I adopted when she was one, and she is now five! She has coat patterns like a cow and is pretty chunky. She sleeps most of the day, and will only play when toys with feathers are involved. However, there is one exception, which is hair ties. Eeveeâ€™s love of hair ties originated early on in my years of having her, and she has different modes of playing depending on the day. When she is in a more laid back mood, she simply bats at it a little and then is all set. Some days, she will fling it around by herself and chase after it a bit. Her serious play-mode days are the most entertaining though, as she will bring a hair tie up to me and start yelling until I take it. She will then wait patiently until I throw it and will sprint after it, before jumping on it and attempting to tear it to shreds. When she is pleased with herself, she will bring it back to me and start meowing again. This process will repeat until she is content with the hunting skills she has displayed for that play session.

        <h3>Evil Koda</h3>

            This is my second cat, Koda, who is a much more evil cat than Eevee. He is a kitten, which is why he is so crazy, but he also has some habits that are just stinky. His most tame issue is sprinting around, because it is just silly most of the time. I do consider it to be an issue though because he will hide in my room, start crying, and then when I come in he will run at me. It almost seems like he is trying to scare me, which is not very cool. Next on the tier list is his problem with jumping on the counter. This relates to the next issue, how much he loves to chew packaging, because if I have anything on the counter, like a cardboard box with plastic in it, he steals it. Eating plastic is not very healthy for cats, so I try to avoid him from doing so, which makes this annoying. Finally, his worst, most evil habit is how he likes to bite hair. If anyone is visiting or if I am sleeping, he will sneak up behind a couch or headboard and start munching on hair. Since he has his little kitten teeth, this hurts quite a bit.
