            This is one of my cats, Eevee. She is a domestic shorthair that I adopted when she was one, and she is now five! She has coat patterns like a cow and is pretty chunky. She sleeps most of the day, and will only play when toys with feathers are involved. However, there is one exception, which is hair ties. Eeveeâ€™s love of hair ties originated early on in my years of having her, and she has different modes of playing depending on the day. When she is in a more laid back mood, she simply bats at it a little and then is all set. Some days, she will fling it around by herself and chase after it a bit. Her serious play-mode days are the most entertaining though, as she will bring a hair tie up to me and start yelling until I take it. She will then wait patiently until I throw it and will sprint after it, before jumping on it and attempting to tear it to shreds. When she is pleased with herself, she will bring it back to me and start meowing again. This process will repeat until she is content with the hunting skills she has displayed for that play session.
