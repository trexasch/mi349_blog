            <h2>Allison Schabel</h2>
            <p>
                Allison is the owner of two awesome cats and a student at Michigan State University. She is a junior and a Games and Interactive Media major, who is currently interested in learning more about website design.
                Her favorite things about them are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How nice it is to pet them since they are so soft</li>
                <li>How silly and goofy they are when they play</li>
                <li>How fun it is to take pictures of them being cute</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The picture below demonstrates her love for games, as she had a Minecraft themed birthday party this year for her 20th birthday. The item on her head is the head of a creeper pinata and it was filled with awesome candy.
